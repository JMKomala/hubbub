            Base64 encoding schemes are commonly used when there is a need to encode binary data that needs be stored and transferred over media that are designed to deal with textual data. This is to ensure that the data remains intact without modification during
            transport. Base64 is used commonly in a number of applications including email via MIME, and storing complex data in XML.
